### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries and Grid layout, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on any screen and create layout of images and texts specifically like it is shown in design. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. Next Challenge was abou calculator functionality. I wrote Js code which calculates all the functions that i mentioned in Challenges section.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
